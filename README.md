# Basic structure for a new Python project


. The top-level directory can contain README's, Config's and whatnot.   
./scripts or ./bin for command-line interface stuff  
./sample_module/tests for your tests  
/doc for most documentation  


Another project's PYTHONPATH, then, can include /path/to/quux/foo to reuse the QUUX.foo module.
